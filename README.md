# Onboarding document for Co-ops in the MBTA Procurement & Logistics Department

Hi, I'm Robert Picard, a current Co-op at the MBTA Procurement & Logistics Department, and in the following bullets, will detail the onboarding process as simply and thoroughly as I can. 

## R:

**Learning `R` -- One of the two main Data Science Programming Language**

  - If you do not have a strong background in R during your first week here, don't worry.

  - First start learning the Tidyverse package in R by learning *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham.

    - http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

  - First learn and practice Chapter 12 -- Tidy Data -- This is by far the most important chapter to learn.

  - After that, read Ch.1-Ch.6, but save Ch.3 -- Data Visualization -- for after Ch.6. Code alongside.

  - Read and code Ch.18. Read Ch.19. Then read Ch.8-11. Code and read Ch.13 and 15.

  - KableExtra is a great package for designing Tables (it's the visual counterpart to `ggplot` but for tables)

      - <https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_pdf.pdf>

  - Topics to tackle as you encounter them, DO NOT forge ahead w/ consultation b/c you can save yourself a lot of effort and work with these packages below:

  |When you encounter...           |Package to use...    |Read or Reference Chapter(s)  |
  |--------------------------------|-------------------  |------------------------------|
  |Dates of any sort               |`lubridate`          |Chpt. 16                      |
  |Strings                         |`stringr`            |Chpt. 14                      |
  |Iteration (For or While loops)  |`purrr`              |Chpt. 21                      |

  - Rmarkdown is somewhat being deprecated as we transition toward more web based interfaces, namely Shiny and Plotly. However it is a valuable tool to be aware of.

  - Do *not* read Section IV on Models (Chpt 22-25) b/c we will model with `Python/Pandas` -- more particularly `SciKitLearn` (`Pandas` is the second Data Science Language we use). http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

## FMIS and Department-Specific Details:

Next, you'll learn **FMIS** -- (Financials & Materials Information System) -- & more about the office by extension.

  1. Go to intranet.mbta.com, under "Enterprise Apps", there is a button - "FMIS", click this

  2. Log in with your MBTA credentials

  3. Learn how to create queries with the help of your supervisor(s)

  4. Always make a copy of any saved queries because a lot of the data is live/active

  5. Always be cautious in constructing new queries because identifying information is in the system

## Miscellaneous

### Administrative

  * Submit time sheets using HR/CMS on intranet
    * Login ID is *different* from FMIS Login
    * After assigned one, call `6045` for a one-time password to login
  * IT help desk is  `5761`, call if you need admin rights on PC
    * `git` and `R` can be installed by yourself

#### Todo:
    \<ROBERT please add Screenshots when you become more familiar with
    FMIS\>
